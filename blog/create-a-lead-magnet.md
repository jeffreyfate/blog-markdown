I’m building a course. The first major milestone is to build a lead magnet and give it away in exchange for email addresses.

The overall goal is to build an audience who is interested enough in solving the problem (this is what the course does), they’ll give up their personal email address.

Historically, I’m not that great at finishing something like this due to a problem of perfectionism. BUT, recently I’ve been realizing more that we don’t have a lot of time. We need to take action and get something done. That is the best way to progress and learn - just do the thing.

So, anyway, this is how I went about building my lead magnet.

A guide is what I decided to build. The idea is to provide a high level instructional document that represent the content of my course. It doesn’t give away my course entirely, but provides value that some one can use (if they want to figure it out on their own) and previews what my course will provide.

My style is to create a document that looks like my code. This is core to my audience: they are very familiar with what Spring Boot application code looks like. The idea is to leverage that look, but instead of Java Doc for the app you get the guide.
