There are almost infinite ways to build software, so why choose Spring Boot? Honestly, I‚Äôm choosing it because it what I‚Äôm currently using in my day job.

BUT, it is a powerful, flexible platform that gives us lots of great features that allow us to build software with quality code.

Spring gives us an IoC container (inversion of control) so we can utilize dependency injection. That keeps our application more loosely coupled. We can swap parts in and out without doing major refactoring.

The add-ons provided by Spring Boot give us quick setup to allow our application to do more. Look how easy it is to add web functionality to a new project.

It has the flexibility to be a platform for microservices or monoliths. Want to build a [serverless application with Spring Boot](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-java-container/wiki/Quick-start---Spring-Boot)? It can do that too.

Ok, so why not Spring Boot?

It isn‚Äôt pure Java. Sure, it isn‚Äôt that lightweight. There are tradeoffs to everything. I argue, though, that built well with discipline, Spring Boot applications are easy to deploy, change, and operate anywhere. You just need to know where to make the right configurations and how to design them.

Ok, but it is soooooo opinionated! Honestly, you don‚Äôt have to use most of the features of Spring Boot if you don‚Äôt want to. But, if you take the time to learn how they are useful, it can make development simpler and more enjoyable. I just recommend you know what is happening underneath. Debugging and troubleshooting becomes almost impossible if you don‚Äôt know enough.

I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of arguments on both sides. The fact of the matter is, Spring Boot is a very mature platform and Java has very extensive world of open source software to help out. It allows for quick starting and continued maintenance. Oh, and static typing! You want that. Trust me, you do.
