I came across [this post](https://blog.trello.com/find-productive-hours) about six months ago and gave the instructions a try.

Basically, the premise is to keep a record of how you feel in certain areas (energy, focus, motivation) each hour of the day. With enough data, you can determine when you personally are best at performing certain types of tasks.

Maybe for you, your focus peaks early in the morning. You should do your deep work then.

Perhaps your energy is best after exercise. If you're feeling sluggish, get a workout in.

As with most, perhaps after lunch is not a great time for your concentration. Time to get (or try) to inbox zero.

Use the spreadsheet linked in the article and start tracking how you feel to better plan out your days. The data doesn't lie...unless you do.
