I have two modes of working. The first, and most enjoyable, is fun working. The second is for real working, where getting value out of the least effort is first priority.

Fun working is all about flow. I just naturally move from one thing to the next and it really is just a never-ending process. But, that's the most enjoyable part about creating and coding. Working in this way doesn't necessarily have a lot to show at the end except learnings. This is a very valid and necessary process to complete, but it doesn't solve a problem.

Work working is all about solving a task or providing immediate business value. (Ok, there are definitely other aspects that don't provide IMMEDIATE value, but that's a different discussion). There's a requirement that software exists to create a solution for. Just get that done with your work.

The problem is that I have trouble shifting between the two. For those lucky (at least I think so) enough to enjoy the feeling of creating software, or at the very least solving a puzzle with code, the desire is to keep coding. We want to keep improving, making it better, prettier, easier. It is many times difficult to break yourself from flow and realize that you have to put int some guardrails.

This is where delayed gratification can come in. It really sounds weird to talk about an idea like delayed gratification when it comes to working, but it fits. The flow (fun working) state has intrinsic gratification. Some of those good feeling chemicals are released in your brain that make you want to keep doing it. However, just like eating a pint (or more) of ice cream in one sitting, it takes some discipline and delayed gratification skills to do it right. In fact, it might be even more gratifying to leave something "half done" because it is easier to pick up the next time you work on it.

We (software engineers, and any creatives working for a business goal) are here to provide value to the business. If only applying 20% of the work to achieve 80% of the value fits the business goal, then we need to stop there. It feels wrong many times, but I have also spent many hours without much to show for it. Only if I had stopped when I had already solved the problem at hand. You can apply whatever mantra you want here: The Pareto Principle, Perfect is the enemy of good, KISS (keep it simple stupid). Just be sure you follow whatever rule you make for yourself, as hard as it may seem when you are in it.
